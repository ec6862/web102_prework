# WEB102 Prework - Fun Funders!
Submitted by: Eric Chen

Fun Funders! is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 5-6 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. <br> <br>
In Challenge 3, it was difficult constructing the necessary steps needed for the 'for loop' because I was unable to piece together the requirements. Since I was still a bit new to the template literals, I was experimenting what would work in template literals. For example, in the following scenario below, how would I know that `<h3> Hello World </h3>` would be read as an HTML element, and not just a string? After experimenting with template literals for a while, I figured out that backticks (``) work differently from parentheses (""), in that backticks allow for other HTML elements to be used, and would classify it if it detected these elements.

It was a new experience working with arrow functions, but I soon enjoyed learning to apply it in these prework challenges, as it was nice to see that it worked exactly the way I wanted to and that I was learning what was expected of me from these challenges.

The final challenge that played a big part in my understanding was in Challenge 6, with the template literal and ternary operator. While the instructions seemed simple at first, I found that applying functions within template literals was a possibility that I could employ in my code. Furthermore, I discovered that in arrow functions when using reduce, that the arrow allowed me to use any function that I create, as long as I returned an output. That means that for my reduce function, I was able to write more than just a return line from the previous examples, and design a functional statement within the function that can help simplify my code!

Overall, it was a very fun experience applying these new concepts that I've learned in the past few days. I'm very thankful for the simplicity of the instructions and examples, as they played a big role in my understanding and helped me grasped these concepts faster than I would've on my own. By seeing examples of the concepts and applying it to the prework challenge, it was enjoyable to know that I was able to complete the necessary steps needed for this challenge, and help me further my understanding within web development comfortably.
